###  Airflow | Kubernetes ‚ò∏Ô∏è
Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestration platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor data pipelines or other workflows.


#### üß± Key Components:
   - **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):**: Workflows in Airflow are defined as DAGs, where each node is a task and edges define execution order.
   - **Python-based**: Pipelines are written in Python code, so they are dynamic and version-controllable instead of being defined by static configuration.
   - **Scheduler & Executor**: The scheduler decides what tasks to run and when, while the executor actually runs them (locally, on Celery, Kubernetes, etc.).
   - **UI & Monitoring**: Airflow provides a web UI to visualize DAGs, check logs, retry failed jobs, and monitor pipeline health
   - **Integrations**: Has operators and hooks to connect with databases, cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), big data frameworks (Spark, Hive), and more.



üéØ Typical Use Cases
```
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
Data warehouse updates (e.g., nightly batch jobs)
Machine learning model training and deployment workflows
Automating business reports
Coordinating complex cloud operations
```
