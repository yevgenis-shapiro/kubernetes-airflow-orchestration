###  Airflow | Kubernetes ‚ò∏Ô∏è
Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestration platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor data pipelines or other workflows.


üß± Key Features of Crossplane 
```
‚úÖ Unified API for Cloud Resources:
Crossplane integrates cloud resources into Kubernetes using CRDs. This means you can manage cloud infrastructure alongside Kubernetes workloads using a single API
‚úÖ Multi-Cloud Management:
Crossplane supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. You can use the same API to manage resources across different cloud platforms
‚úÖ Declarative Infrastructure Management:
Like Kubernetes resources, Crossplane allows you to define your desired infrastructure state declaratively. Once defined, Crossplane continuously reconciles your infrastructure to match this state.
‚úÖ Composable Infrastructure:
Crossplane lets you bundle multiple cloud resources together into higher-level abstractions, called Compositions and Composite Resources (XRs), allowing for reusable and simplified infrastructure components.
‚úÖ Kubernetes-Native GitOps:
Crossplane works well with GitOps practices, enabling teams to manage cloud infrastructure in the same way they manage Kubernetes workloads: declaratively and with continuous reconciliation.
‚úÖ Community and Ecosystem:
Being an open-source project, Crossplane has a growing community and a rich ecosystem of providers and compositions that you can leverage.
